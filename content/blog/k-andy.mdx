Zero friction Kubernetes stack on Hetzner Cloud.

This [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) module will install a High Availability [K3s](https://k3s.io/) Cluster with Embedded DB in a private network on [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/de/cloud). The following resources are provisionised by default (**20â‚¬/mo**):

- 3x Control-plane: _CX11_, 2GB RAM, 1VCPU, 20GB NVMe, 20TB Traffic.
- 2x Worker: _CX21_, 4GB RAM, 2VCPU, 40GB NVMe, 20TB Traffic.
- Network: Private network with one subnet.
- Server and agent nodes are distributed across 3 Datacenters (nbg1, fsn1, hel1) for high availability.
