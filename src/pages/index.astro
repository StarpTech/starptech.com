  <h2>More</h2>
  <p>
    I've been in software engineering and research for over ten years,
    developing a passion for creating innovative software that solves hard
    problems at scale. My career has involved solving complex issues, from
    designing and implementing API Gateways to developing and operating complete
    modern SaaS solutions like <a href="https://wundergraph.com"
      >WunderGraph Cosmo</a
    >. While I was always looking for new technical challenges, I've also been
    involved in building and leading teams. Mentoring and guiding others to
    success has been a rewarding experience for me.
    <br /><br />This has led me to become a tech lead at WunderGraph, where I
    can guide teams to success by providing technical direction and support. I'm
    a big believer in Open Source and have been contributing to various projects
    over the years. I am also a contributor to several open-source projects,
    including WunderGraph, Cosmo, HemeraJs, Fastify, OTEL, and many more. I'm
    always looking for new ways to contribute to the community or to build new
    projects that might evolve into something bigger.

    Currently, I am Co-Founder & Tech Lead at WunderGraph. We're building the
    complete solution to build, manage, and deploy federated GraphQL APIs.
    GraphQL is the technology companies need to facilitate the development of a
    unified API layer that can be consumed not only by users but also by
    internal teams to accelerate innovation in companies. Data is the new oil,
    and we're here to help companies leverage their data in a more efficient
    way.
