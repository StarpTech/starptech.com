    Welcome to my blog! My name is Dustin, Co-Founder and Tech Lead at
    WunderGraph, where we're shaping the future of how businesses use GraphQL
    with our platform, <a href="https://cosmo-docs.wundergraph.com/">Cosmo</a>.
    My role involves leading a talented team, guiding our technical vision. I'm
    dedicated to making our platform the first choice for companies looking to
    scale and weave their GraphQL APIs seamlessly, whether they're operating on
    local servers, in the cloud, or using Kubernetes.

  <p>
    I've been navigating the software engineering and research world for over a
    decade, nurturing a genuine enthusiasm for developing Open-Source software
    that truly makes a difference. My professional journey has been filled with
    exciting challenges. From building
    <a href="https://bff-patterns.com/">Backend for Frontend's</a>, enhancing
    API performance with GraphQL Edge Caching in Rust to simplifying API
    integrations by building a programmable API-Gateway called <a
      href="https://github.com/wundergraph/wundergraph">WunderGraph Gateway</a
    >.
